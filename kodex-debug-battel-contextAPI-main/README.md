## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Welcome to the **Debug Battle**! You've been handed a **Habit Tracker** application built with **React**, **Vite**, and the **Context API**. The app is designed to let users create daily habits, mark them as complete, track streaks, edit, and delete habits.

**There's just one problem — the codebase is riddled with bugs.** 💥

The application looks like it should work, but almost nothing functions correctly. Your mission is to find and fix **all the bugs** hidden across the project files to get the app fully working.

## 📋 Rules

1. **Find and fix all the bugs** in the codebase.
2. Bugs are spread across **multiple files** — no file is safe!   - 🔴 **State & mutation issues**
   - 🔴 **React rendering bugs**
   - 🔴 **Logic & conditional errors**
   - 🔴 **Date handling mistakes**
   - 🔴 **Context API misuse**
   - 🔴 **Missing function invocations**
3. The app should be **fully functional** after all bugs are fixed.
4. Do **NOT** change the overall architecture or structure — only fix what's broken.

## 🧩 App Description

The **Habit Tracker** app allows users to:

- ✅ **Add new habits** via a form (name, goal value)
- ✅ **View a list of habits** on the dashboard
- ✅ **Toggle habit completion** for the current day
- ✅ **Track streaks** — consecutive days a habit was completed
- ✅ **Edit habit details** inline
- ✅ **Delete habits** from the list
- ✅ **Show All / Show Less** toggle for the habit list
- ✅ **See stats** like progress percentage and top category
